All program control operations are going to be instance methods on the
`ProgramControl` class. The `ProgramControl` class connects the command line
interface to the file handler and cipher components. It retrieves files from
the `data` directory (via `FileHandler`) and optionally decrypts them (via
`Cipher`). This class should be instantiated by the user interface layer.

## Listing files

```java
public String start();
```

The `start` method with no arguments will list all files in the `data`
directory with corresponding numbers. Each file is displayed on a separate
line with a two-digit number (01, 02, etc.) followed by the file name. If
the `data` directory is empty or does not exist, the method returns
`"No files found."`.

## Reading and decrypting a file with default cipher key

```java
public String start(@NonNull String arg);
```

The `start` method with one argument will read a file from the `data`
directory by its number (1-based index from the listing) and decrypt it
using the default cipher key (`key.txt` from the `ciphers` directory). The
`arg` parameter must be a valid number corresponding to a file in the listing.
If the file number is invalid (out of range, negative, zero, or not a number),
the method returns `"Invalid file number."`. If the `data` directory is empty
or does not exist, the method returns `"No files found."`. If the file cannot
be read, the method returns `"Error reading file."`.

## Reading and decrypting a file with specified cipher key

```java
public String start(@NonNull String arg, @NonNull String path);
```

The `start` method with two arguments will read a file from the `data`
directory by its number and decrypt it using the specified cipher key file
from the `ciphers` directory. The `arg` parameter must be a valid file number
(1-based index), and the `path` parameter specifies the cipher key file name.
Error handling is the same as the single-argument version: returns
`"Invalid file number."` for invalid numbers, `"No files found."` for empty
directory, and `"Error reading file."` for file access errors.
