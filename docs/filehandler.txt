All file accesses are going to be static methods on the `FileHandler` class. The
`FileHandler` class will look for files in the `data` directory in the project
root. It should be placed next to the `src` directory.

## Checking if files can be accessed

```java
public static boolean checkFile(@NonNull String fileName);
```

The `checkFile` method will take a non-null file name as a parameter and will
return `true` if the file exists and can be read, and `false` otherwise.

## Reading files

```java
public static @Nullable String readFile(@NonNull String fileName);
```

The `readFile` method will take a non-null file name as a parameter and will
return the contents of the file as a single string if successful. If the file
cannot be read, if it does not exist, or if any other error occurs, the method
will return `null`. Use `checkFile` to verify that the file exists before
attempting to read it.
