All file accesses are going to be static methods on the `FileHandler` class. The
`FileHandler` class will look for files in either the `ciphers` or `data` 
directory in the project root. These directories should be placed next to the 
`src` directory.

## Checking if files can be accessed

```java
public static boolean checkFile(
    @NonNull String directory,
    @NonNull String fileName
);
```

The `checkFile` method will take a non-null directory and file name as parameters
and will return `true` if the file exists and can be read, and `false` otherwise.
The `directory` parameter must be either `"ciphers"` or `"data"` - any other
value will raise an exception.

## Reading files

```java
public static @Nullable String readFile(
    @NonNull String directory,
    @NonNull String fileName
);
```

The `readFile` method will take a non-null directory and file name as parameters
and will return the contents of the file as a single string if successful. The
`directory` parameter must be either `"ciphers"` or `"data"` - any other value
will raise an exception. If the file cannot be read, if it does not exist, or if
any other error occurs, the method will return `null`. Use `checkFile` to verify
that the file exists before attempting to read it.
