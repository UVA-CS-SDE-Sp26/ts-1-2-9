All file accesses are going to be static methods on the `FileHandler` class. The
`FileHandler` class will look for files in either the `ciphers` or `data` 
directory in the project root. These directories should be placed next to the 
`src` directory.

## Checking if files can be accessed

```java
public static boolean checkFile(
    @NonNull String directory,
    @NonNull String fileName
);
```

The `checkFile` method will take a non-null directory and file name as parameters
and will return `true` if the file exists and can be read, and `false` otherwise.
The `directory` parameter must be either `"ciphers"` or `"data"` - any other
value will raise an exception.

## Reading files

```java
public static @Nullable String readFile(
    @NonNull String directory,
    @NonNull String fileName
);
```

The `readFile` method will take a non-null directory and file name as parameters
and will return the contents of the file as a single string if successful. The
`directory` parameter must be either `"ciphers"` or `"data"` - any other value
will raise an exception. If the file cannot be read, if it does not exist, or if
any other error occurs, the method will return `null`. Use `checkFile` to verify
that the file exists before attempting to read it.

## Listing files

```java
public static @Nullable List<String> listFiles(
    @NonNull String directory
);
```

The `listFiles` method will take a non-null directory as a parameter and will
return a list of file names (as strings) in that directory. The `directory`
parameter must be either `"ciphers"` or `"data"` - any other value will raise
an exception. Only regular files are included in the list, not subdirectories.
If the directory does not exist, cannot be read, or if any other error occurs,
the method will return `null`. An empty list is returned if the directory
exists but contains no files.
